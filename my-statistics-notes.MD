probability (P)  - numerical value
sample space (S) - well defined SET of possible outcomes (of an experiment)
event            - well defined SET of          outcomes (of an experiment) with a probability
experiment       - any procedure that can be infinitely repeated, has a sample space

#1
probability of sample space (S) = P(S) = 1
