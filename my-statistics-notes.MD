probability (P)  - numerical value
sample space (S) - well defined SET of possible outcomes (of an experiment)
event (A,B, etc) - well defined SET of          outcomes (of an experiment) with a probability
                   is subset of sample space (S)
experiment       - any procedure that can be infinitely repeated, has a sample space

#1
probability of sample space (S) = P(S) = 1

#2
probability of event (A) = P(A) is beteen 0 and 1, both inclusive, 0<=P(A)<=1
