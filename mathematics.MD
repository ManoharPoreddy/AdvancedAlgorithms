BODMAS is an acronym and it stands for Bracket, Of, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction.
In certain regions, PEDMAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction) is the synonym of BODMAS.

non-statistical - single value like age
statistical question - multiple values - need to gather info about 1+ items/people, etc.
histogram

mean		a+b+c+d)/4
median		mid element, OR average(2 mid elements)
mode 		most often
range = max - min

. interquartile range (IQR)
. 	sort asc
. 	find median
. 	IQR = lower half's median - upper half's median

box plot
min		Q1					median	Q3				max
min		lower quartile(		median	lower quartile	max

. Mean absolute deviation (MAD)
. 	find mean
. 	average (abs   each ele - mean)

double number lines - show the ratio
dot plot - most often/ frequent, helps finding median, more than x, max and specific - below x
bar graph/histogram - helps finding more than x, less than (some are good, some dont tell)
box & whiskers plot - helps finding median

distribution
	left-tailed - decreasing towards left   (approximate: skewed to the left:  mean is to the left of median and mode)
	right-tailed - decreasing towards right (approximate: skewed to the right: mean is to the right of median and mode)
	approximately symmetrical - both left-tailed & right-tailed - median will be close to center

	for dot plot (only?) we can see below:
		outlier = an end element that is far to the right/left - isolated one data point (unusually low or unusually high)
		cluster = grouping of data, between two data points, from x to y, saying 100 to 200
		peak = most frequent data item
		gap = (no values)?

====
algebra
	variables
	expressions
	equations = a statement that two expressions are equal
		value of the variable that makes a true equation is called a solution to the equation
we always have to do the same thing to both sides of an equation to keep it true
Addition and subtraction are inverse operations

inverse operation of addition is subtraction
inverse operation of subtraction is addition

Multiplication and division are inverse operations
inverse operation of division is multiplication
inverse operation of multiplication is division

Inequalities show the relation between two expressions that are not equal.

independent variable is a variable that represents a quantity that is being manipulated in an experiment
dependent variable represents a quantity whose value depends on how the independent variable is manipulated

====
0 is neither -ve or +ve
0/n=0			n!=0 
n/0=undefined
0/0=undefined

1*n = n
1*0 = 0
1*1 = 1

n^1 = n
n^0 = 1		n!=0
0^n=0	n!=0
0^0 = undefined

====
25% of 600 is 150
25% . 600 = 150
percent . base = amount

10% = 10/100 = 1/10 = 0.1

~	approximately equal

====

shares of stock = how much a person (shareholder) owns in a company
    profits (dividends) can be equal or not
====

polyhedron
polyhedra
    3d shape
    flat surfaces
    straight edges
Surface area is   the amount of space covering the outside of a three-dimensional shape.
