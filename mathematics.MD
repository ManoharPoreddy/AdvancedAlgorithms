This Mathematics Notes is from  khanacademy.org/math
where I got Ramanujan in 60 actual days - possibly 3 hours of work everyday

====
BODMAS is an acronym and it stands for Bracket, Of, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction.
In certain regions,
  PEDMAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction) is the synonym of BODMAS.

====
non-statistical      - single value like age
statistical question - multiple values - need to gather info about 1+ items/people, etc.

double number lines - show the ratio
dot plot - most often/ frequent, helps finding median, more than x, max and specific - below x
bar graph/histogram - helps finding more than x, less than (some are good, some dont tell)
box & whiskers plot - helps finding median

distribution
  left-tailed - decreasing towards left   (approximate: skewed to the left:  mean is to the left  of median and mode)
  right-tailed - decreasing towards right (approximate: skewed to the right: mean is to the right of median and mode)
  approximately symmetrical - both left-tailed & right-tailed - median will be close to center
 
  for dot plot (only?) we can see below:
    outlier = an end element that is far to the right/left - isolated one data point (unusually low or unusually high)
    cluster = grouping of data, between two data points, from x to y, saying 100 to 200
    peak = most frequent data item
    gap = (no values)?

mean    (a+b+c+d)/4
median  mid element, OR average(2 mid elements)
mode    most often
range = max - min

. interquartile range (IQR)
.     sort asc
.     find median
.     IQR = lower half's median - upper half's median

box plot
min        Q1                     median    Q3                max
min        lower quartile         median    upper quartile    max

range = max - min
4     = 15    - 11
                            // 0? <a10b>    ??
min     median      max
11?     13          15?

|a - b| = |a| - |b|
|a - b| = |b - a|

. Mean absolute deviation (MAD)
.     find mean
.     average (abs each ele - mean)

====
algebra
    variables
    expressions
    equations = a statement that two expressions are equal
        value of the variable that makes a true equation is called a solution to the equation
we always have to do the same thing to both sides of an equation to keep it true
Addition and subtraction are inverse operations

inverse operation of addition is subtraction
inverse operation of subtraction is addition

Multiplication and division are inverse operations
inverse operation of division is multiplication
inverse operation of multiplication is division

Inequalities show the relation between two expressions that are not equal.

>= closed circle and arrow

independent variable is a variable that represents a quantity that is being manipulated in an experiment
dependent variable represents a quantity whose value depends on how the independent variable is manipulated

====
0 is neither -ve or +ve
0/n=0         where n != 0 
n/0=undefined
0/0=undefined

1*n = n

1*0 = 0
1*1 = 1

n^1 = n
n^0 = 1       where n != 0
0^n=0         where n != 0
0^0 = undefined

====
25% of 600 is 150
25% . 600 = 150
percent . base = amount

10% = 10/100 = 1/10 = 0.1

~  approximately equal

====
shares of stock = how much a person (shareholder) owns in a company
    profits (dividends) can be equal or not

====
polyhedron
polyhedra
    3d shape
    flat surfaces
    straight edges
Surface area is   the amount of space covering the outside of a three-dimensional shape.

TIPS for khanacademy.org/math

use your calculator instead of given calculator - its a bit cramped

How to work?
    instead of doing only arithmetic, OR geometry
    i would do 1st class, then 2nd class,
		this looks a bit slow but they are better in understanding many things at little bit each

verify
    after each answer
    i verify in a different way
        if 2+4+5 is given
            first,               i will add 2+4 then add 5    = 11
            for verification,    i will add 4+5 then add 2    = 11
    if both are same, i will Check/ Submit

viewed videos at
    X2 speed, possibly after viewing few videos
        1st 1 or 2 videos are at 1.5 video speed rate
        later videos are at 2 video speed rate

if its text box
    that does not give the symbols input
    then you can press ENTER to submit answer

if from desktop
    you can view all videos at once, continuously

From 6th grade the volume of video seems very slow
    GOOD PLUGIN
        I used Volume Booster extension of Chrome browser
		listen to video/audio sound a bit louder
		https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/volume-booster/ejkiikneibegknkgimmihdpcbcedgmpo/related
    BAD PLUGIN
        I installed another chrome extension
		https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-playback-speed-co/hdannnflhlmdablckfkjpleikpphncik/reviews?hl=en
		and went at 2.25 speed
		remembers speed 2.00    Options > Settings tab > 'Remember Playback Speed For All Videos'
		but 2.25 failed
		This failed as the points were not coming as usual
